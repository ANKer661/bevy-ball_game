# bevy-ball-game
This project is a small game build by [Bevy Game Engine](https://bevyengine.org/) version `0.11.0`.

This project followed [Jacques](https://www.youtube.com/@jacques-dev)'s vedio tutorial of learning the basics of the Bevy Game Engineon series on YouTube.

The tutorial is based on Bevy `0.10`. If you are interested in the tutorial, you can find it [in this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQt-v_bFdao).

Jacques suggest to stick to bevy `0.10` in this tutorial. But, if you want to do it with bevy `0.11`, you can follow Jacques's tutorial and come here to check what you need to adjust
your codes to bevy `0.11`. Alternatively, bevy's [Migration Guide: 0.10 to 0.11](https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/0.10-0.11/) 
is also a good option for following Jacques's tutorial with bevy `0.11`.

Have fun!
